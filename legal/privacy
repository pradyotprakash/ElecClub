<h2>What Information About Me Is Collected and Stored?</h2>

<p>Company adheres to the highest standards of ethical practices in all of our operations and is dedicated to protecting the privacy of all visitors to our Website and users of our services and products. <strong>Our Privacy Policy is simple: Except as disclosed below, we don't sell, barter, give away, or rent your personal information to any company outside of Company.</strong></p>

<h3>Personal Information</h3>

<p>For purposes of registration and use of our services, we collect identifiable information about you and your authorized users such as subscriber name, subscriber website, user ID, email address, telephone numbers, billing information (such as credit card number), and demographic information such as zip code (“Personal Information”). We also collect and store information that you enter into the Control Panel of the Website or that you provide through our help desk, customer service representatives, or requests for more information. Registration may also be required and Personal Information may also be collected in certain portions of the Website in which you specifically and knowingly provide such information (e.g. blog comments, if any). We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources, to enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database.</p>
<p>More specifically, we collect the following Personal Information in the following circumstances: (1) when you visit our Website, we collect your IP address, HTTP referrer information and requested pages, and we log such information into plain text and SQL databases; (2) when you sign up for our services or products, we collect your IP address, HTTP referrer information, requested pages, username, email address, URLs, billing and mailing addresses, and credit card (number, expiration date, and CCV) or paypal billing information, and we log such information into plain text and SQL databases; (3) if you log into our services via SSH and SFTP, we collect your IP address, reverse DNS information and initial commands, and we log such information into secured local and remote text files and SQL databases; (4) if you execute programs or script on our servers, we collect the user, script name and binaries used, and we log such information into secured local and remote text files and SQL databases; and (5) if you submit issues via email or any other support system, we collect your IP address, username, URLs and email address; (6) if you choose to add new users to your account.</p>

<h3>Anonymous Information</h3>
<p>In addition, when you interact with the Website, our servers may keep an activity log that does not identify you individually (“Anonymous Information”). Generally, this Anonymous Information is collected though “traffic data”. We collect and store certain administrative and traffic information with each use of the service or Website including: source IP address, time of access, date of access, web page(s), software crash reports, type of browser used, session identification number, search terms, search results, access times and referring websites addresses.</p>

<h3>Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
<p>Also, like many websites, we use “cookies”, which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences. We use cookies to track use of our Website and online services. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Website and make it easier and/or relevant for your use. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on our Website.</p>
<p>You may occasionally get cookies from third party companies while on our Website.  We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.

<h3>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h3>
<p>We employ, or our third-party tracking utility partner employs, a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on our Website by informing us which content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We  do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our Clients’ Personal Information. </p>

<h3>Is Information Collected From Children?</h3>
<p>This is not a Website directed to children under the age of 13, and Company does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age you should not use this Website, and under no circumstance should you send information about yourself to Company. If Company discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided Company with Personal Information, Company will immediately delete that child’s information from the Website.</p>

We also use this information to improve our Control Panel, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our Website and, as described below, enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf. Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to our Website or your Personal Information collected online to any companies not affiliated with us.</p>

<h3>Customer Service and Feedback</h3>
<p>We may use your Personal Information to fulfill support requests, provide customer service/support, track your compliance with the Company’s Acceptable Use Policy, or for feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when you provide the information). In the event we plan to publicly post any of your Personal Information on the Website, we will request your permission to provide such posting.</p>

<h3>Use of Anonymous Information</h3>
<p>We use Anonymous Information to help us determine how people use parts of the Website and who our users are so we can improve our Website and ensure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many people as possible. We may also use or share Anonymous Information (or other information, other than Personal Information) in any other manner that we deem appropriate or necessary.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Agents</h3>
<p>We occasionally have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and partners that perform functions on our behalf, such as marketing, analytics, credit card processing, providing customer service/support, fraud protection, etc. These entities have access to the Personal Information needed to perform their functions and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that Personal Information. They are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to Company.</p>

<h3>Emergency Situations</h3>
<p>We may also use or disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or the Website; (b) protect and defend the our rights or property, the Website or our users, and © act under emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of us, our affiliates, agents, or the users of the Website or the public, or respond to a government request.

In addition, we use standard security protocols and mechanisms such as secure socket layer technology (SSL) in the transmission of certain sensitive Personal Information, such as credit card information.</p>
<p>While we try our best to safeguard your Personal Information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>We comply with the following data retention policies with respect to your Personal Information: (1) we permanently retain in an encrypted format of your billing information; (2) we may permanently retain your forum and weblog contributions; and (3) we may permanently retain your support emails, web logs and accounting logs, though we reserve the right to destroy such information after a period of six months.

If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your Personal Information to provide you services contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@tier3.com">privacy@tier3.com</a>.</p>
